    <h3 class="tittle2">Mixed Berry Galette</h3>

    <p class="comment">"I’m dreaming of berry season! One of my favorite things to make with berries is a pie or galette. I feel like it’s a dessert that really showcases their natural juicy flavor. Galettes are usually open faced, but I decided to decorate the top of this mixed berry one with a little extra pastry dough. I think It’s a nice finishing touch."</p>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h3 class="tittle3" >INGREDIENTS</h3>

        <h4>Crust</h4>
        <ul> 
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, leveled</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons butter, cold and cut into cubes</li> 
            <li>11 tablespoons ice cold water</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul> 
            <li>6 ounces blueberries, washed</li>
            <li>6 ounces blackberries, washed</li> 
            <li>6 ounces raspberries, washed
            <li>tablespoon flour</li> 
            <li>1/ 3 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="steps">
        <h4 class="tittle4">Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the dough, add the 2 cups of flour to a large bowl. Then, add the cold and thinly sliced butter and use a fork or a pastry cutter to combine it until crumbs form. Next, add 11 tbsp of the ice cold water and stir until a dough forms. Add an additional tablespoon if it seems to dry.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a thick disk, and wrap it with plastic wrap. Place it in the fridge to chill for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the dough is chilling make your filling. Rinse the berries and place them in a medium bowl with the flour, sugar and lemon juice. Stir to combine, cover and set aside.</li>
            <li>Once your dough has chilled, roll it out on a floured surface until it’s about 1/4 in thick, creating a large area that you can trim down to about a 12-13 inch circle. Set the scraps aside to decorate the top, or store them in an air tight container to freeze and use again later.</li>
            <li>Place your circle of dough on a large sheet or pizza pan lined with parchment paper and preheat your oven to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>Spread the berry filling onto the dough, leaving about 2-3 inches of empty space around the diameter. Fold this extra dough over the filling, and place your galette into the oven to bake for 30 minutes - or until the crust is golden brown. **I like to brush the crust with a little milk or egg wash before baking to help it get nice and golden.**</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool a bit before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
