<h3>No Bake Banana Rum Cheesecake</h3>

<p>"Since I’m not a baker I like to find recipes that I can impress my guests with that even I can pull off. This No Bake Banana Rum Cheesecake definitely fits the bill.  For one: it doesn’t require baking (hence the name), and for two: with a quick banana rum topping, this cheesecake seems like it was bought at a bakery instead of made in only minutes".</p>

<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<h4>Crust</h4>
<ul> 
    <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons granulated white sugar</li>
</ul>
<h4>Filling</h4>
<ul> 
    <li>Two 8- ounce packages cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/2 cup granulated white sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon banana extract</li>
    <li>1 ounce (2 tablespoons) dark rum</li>
</ul>
<h4>Topping</h4>
<ul> 
    <li>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 ounces (1/4 cup) dark rum</li>
    <li>2 large bananas, sliced into 1/4" thick slices</li>
</ul>

<h4>STEPS</h4>
<ol>
    <li> In a medium bowl, combine the crust ingredients.  Press this mixture into the bottom of your springform pan (either a 9-inch or 4 individual 4 1/2-inch pans) using a glass to press down firmly.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the filling ingredients; beat for 3 minutes, or until smooth.</li>
    <li>Scrape the filling evenly into the 4 springform pans, or scrape all of the filling into one 9-inch springform pan.</li>
    <li>Chill in the refrigerator for 4 hours or up to two days.</li>
    <li>Make the banana topping by adding 4 tablespoons of butter to a large skillet and heat over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, stir in the brown sugar.  Carefully pour in the rum and cook for 3 to 4 minutes while stirring.</li>
    <li>Add in the sliced bananas and cook for 5 minutes, flipping the bananas over halfway through.</li>
    <li>Remove the cheesecake(s) from the springform pans by running a knife around the edges first and carefully loosening the spring on the pan.</li>
    <li> Spoon the banana topping over the cheesecake and serve.</li>
