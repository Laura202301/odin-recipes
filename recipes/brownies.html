<h3>Chocolate Chip Walnut Brownies</h3>

<p>"These brownies are awesome because they’re just full of everything good.  Picture a really good brownie recipe.  Then picture a ton of chocolate chips and chopped walnuts being sprinkled on top before baking.  Those chocolate chips and walnuts bake into the top of these brownies, giving them a visually appealing look and a pretty good all-around tasty brownie in the end".</p>
