Entry 1: This is a basic recipe website with a 'brutalist web design', because I've only learnt HTML (so far). I created an index page with links to other pages. The pages show different recipes, with their correspondent picture, list of ingredients and steps required to make the dish. First I created my index page and set up the boilerplate, then I used different HTML elements such as: headings, paragraphs, links, images and attributes, unordered lists and ordered lists.

Entry 2: I learnt some CSS and added style to the recipes page. I learnt about selectors, classes, IDs. Grouping, chaining selectors and the descendant combinator. I changed the font style, the text color and its backround. I added pictures and styled the pictures, also added one pic as backround and styled it as well. I also learnt about the cascade and the order of importance, origin and specificity.
